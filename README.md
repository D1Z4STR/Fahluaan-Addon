# Introduction #

Welcome to my first Github page and my second Skyrim addon! This addon will integrate various mods I would see fit into the world of Skyrim alongside the amazing Fahluaan mod list and these mods will not require a conflict resolution patch of any kind (doing this to keep it simple and not having to create a Nexus page for a few patches). This will be an easy **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, installation, rearranging plugins, etc. All mods in my addon are **OPTIONAL** and I will note specific information as we go.

**Currently designed to work with version 1.3.1 of Fahluaan.** A changelog is provided at the bottom.

# Installation - please read...

Firstly, on the left side of MO2 find at the bottom the Separator called 'Disabled Mods' We will right-click that separator and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". Name it **[NoDelete] Fahluaan - D1Z4STR's Edition** or whichever you like.
*Your choice of the following mods will be installed under this separator*

**IMPORTANT PLUGIN PLACEMENT** All the plugins installed on the right side of MO2 under the plugins tab will be placed above DynDOLOD.esp in order with the exception of *noted* mods.

*Screenshots are available at the bottom of this page for reference*

## Let's Begin!
